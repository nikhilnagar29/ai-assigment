"For a car that claims 425 km WLTP range, the reality is far from it. I barely managed 305 km on a mild 18°C day with mixed highway and city driving. Once you cross 110 km/h, the consumption shoots past 24 kWh/100 km. And don’t even ask about winter – the range drops below 250 km with heater on. BMW should stop advertising the ideal lab-tested numbers like they translate to the real world.", Negative, Reddit, 2025-10-22 11:20:45, u/range_shattered, Toronto, 0.93
"The charging curve looks great on paper, but the 10–80% in 31 min only works on the perfect charger with perfect temperature. In my 4 DC fast charging sessions, the car throttled to 65 kW after 55% SOC, meaning the remaining 30% took longer than the first 50%. Porsche Taycan and Kia EV6 hold higher speeds much longer. For a premium EV, this feels outdated already.", Negative, EV Forum, 2025-10-22 15:42:17, tech_drive_alex, Amsterdam, 0.90
"At 2.5 tons, the braking performance is simply not confidence-inspiring. You feel the mass in emergency stops, especially on downhill roads. Regenerative braking is strong in ‘B’ mode, but transitions between regen and friction brakes are jerky. My old Audi e-tron, which is also heavy, somehow feels more predictable and stable under braking. This car needs better brake tuning.", Negative, YouTube Comment, 2025-10-23 09:11:29, autoTruthTV, Chicago, 0.88
"BMW keeps advertising ‘luxury’ but the software is nowhere near that level. The curved display UI froze twice while navigating, and the voice assistant randomly activates when no one speaks. OTA update took 42 minutes and failed the first time. iDrive 8 has too many layers just to change a basic climate setting. Tesla may look childish in UI, but at least it works instantly.", Negative, Trustpilot, 2025-10-23 13:55:12, robbie_reviews, London, 0.91
"The suspension feels soft at low speeds and then too floaty at highway speeds. The air suspension tries to mask the weight, but when the road gets uneven, the car feels like a boat. Meanwhile, the Mercedes EQS SUV manages to feel planted and comfortable at the same time. BMW needs to decide if this is a driver’s SUV or a luxury couch, because right now it’s neither.", Negative, Blog Review, 2025-10-23 17:49:22, drivernote, Dubai, 0.86
"BMW talks a lot about sustainable materials like ECONYL carpets and recycled plastic, which is good, but what about long-term durability? After only 4 months, the driver seat side bolster is already showing wear. That never happened in my 6-year-old Lexus.

"Driver assistance is borderline dangerous sometimes. Lane-keep assist fights you on wide curves, and parking sensors go crazy in rain. The system also brakes randomly when it misreads a shadow as an obstacle. I paid extra for ‘Parking Assistant Plus’ and now I switch it off most of the time. BMW, please fix software before selling extra features.", Negative, Reddit, 2025-10-24 12:18:55, u/adas_trauma, New York, 0.89
"The tyres (21-inch) look great but cost €480 each to replace and wear out fast because of the weight and torque. In 8,000 km I have 30% tread left. BMW’s answer? ‘Normal for performance EVs.’ No, it’s not normal. Tesla Model Y Performance still gets 20–25k km from its tyres, and it's faster.", Negative, Twitter, 2025-10-24 16:40:41, @paying4rubber, Paris, 0.87
"After only 5 fast charges, the battery temp hit 52°C and the car reduced power output. You can literally feel the acceleration slowdown. If this is how BMW manages heat in a €90k EV, I’m worried about long-term battery health.

"The car is quiet but not silent. Above 120 km/h, tyre noise and wind noise are noticeable, especially near the A-pillars. For something marketed as a ‘luxury EV lounge’, it falls short compared to EQS or even Volvo EX90.
